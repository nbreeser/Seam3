  s.description      = <<-DESC
Seam3 is a framework built to bridge gaps between CoreData and CloudKit. It almost handles all the CloudKit hassle. 
All you have to do is use it as a store type for your CoreData store. 
Local caching and sync is taken care of. 
It builds and exposes different features to facilitate and give control to the developer where it is demanded and required.

Seam3 is based on [Seam](https://github.com/nofelmahmood/Seam) by [nofelmahmood](https://github.com/nofelmahmood/)

Changes in Seam3 include:

* Corrects one-to-many and many-to-one relationship mapping between CoreData and CloudKit
* Adds mapping between binary attributes in CoreData and CKAssets in CloudKit
* Code updates for Swift 3.0
* Restructures code to eliminate the use of global variables
